						<p> The ultimate goal of cosmology is to understand the evolution of the Universe and shine light on the fundamental laws of Physics. My work comes in at the interface of theory and observations and is geared towards extracting as much information as possible from the data: typically this means observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB, relic light from the Big Bang) or the shape and distribution of galaxies, which delineates the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. </p>

                        <p>A focal point of my work is using the gravitational lensing of background images such as the CMB or galaxies by the large-scale distribution of matter to
							test the cosmological model and fundamental Physics, including the nature of gravity and neutrinos. This information can also be used to sharpen observations of the B-mode polarization
						of the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">CMB</a>. The latter is a crucial step in the search for the very weak primordial
						B-mode signal that is thought to have been produced by gravitational waves generated during
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)"> cosmic inflation</a>, a tiny
						fraction of a second after the beginning of time.

						<p> Though I am a primarily a theorist, I like to work at the interface with data and am lucky to do
							so as member of two major and highly complementary international collaborations: the <a
							href="https://simonsobservatory.org/">Simons Observatory (SO)</a>, where I co-lead the delensing working group, and the <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic
								Instrument (DESI)</a>, where I am coordinating a DR2 Key Project jointly analyzing galaxy clustering with lensing observables.</p>

						<p> I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)"> Galicia</a>, and I have had the pleasure to live in other beautiful places such as British Columbia, New York, Cambridge and California. I enjoy all things outdoors, and I care deeply about social justice.
						<p> FAQ about my name: my first name is Antón, and I have two last names, Baleato and Lizancos, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs#Galician_names"> as is traditional in the Iberian peninsula and much of the world</a>. Baleato comes from my father, and Lizancos from my mother. You will find that in my articles I use both, but please feel free to refer to me just by one (typically Antón Baleato).  </p>
