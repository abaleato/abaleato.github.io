							<h2> Research</h2>
						</header>
						<p> The ultimate goal of cosmology is to understand the evolution of the Universe and shine light on the fundamental laws of Physics. My work comes in at the interface of theory and observations and is geared towards extracting as much information as possible from the data: typically this means observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB, relic light from the Big Bang) or the shape and distribution of galaxies, which delineates the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe. </p>

                        <p>A focal point of my work is in using the gravitational lensing of the CMB caused by the large-scale distribution of matter to
							test the cosmological model and fundamental Physics. One very active topic of research that I am involved in is the reconstruction and removal of lensing-induced contamination from the observed B-mode polarization
						of the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">CMB</a>. This is a crucial step in the search for the very weak primordial
						B-mode signal that is thought to have been produced by gravitational waves generated during
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)"> cosmic inflation</a>, a tiny
						fraction of a second after the beginning of time.

                        <p> In parallel to this, I am developing methods to improve the precision and accuracy of CMB
						lensing measurements and their cross-correlation with other tracers of the matter distribution
						such as galaxies. These probes allow for precise
						constraints on the mass of the neutrinos, dark energy and dark matter.</p>

						<p> I am also pioneering new methods to analyze the angular clustering of galaxies and the distortions of their shapes
							imprinted by gravitational lensing. This takes the form of more efficient and accurate algorithms that take advantage of state-of-the art
							computing (e.g. on GPUs), as well as an improved understanding of how observational
							non-idealities affect our measurements. These observables are among the most powerful cosmological probes, and will only grow in importance with the advent of the <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic
								Instrument (DESI)</a>, the <a href=" https://www.lsst.org/">Vera Rubin Observatory</a>
							and <a href=" https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid">Euclid
							</a>.</p>

						<p> Though I am a theorist, I like to work at the interface with data and am lucky to do
							so as member of two international collaborations: the <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic
								Instrument (DESI)</a> and the <a
									href="https://simonsobservatory.org/">Simons Observatory (SO)</a>, where I co-lead the delensing working group. In tandem, these two experiments promise to
							provide deep insights into the workings of our Universe.</p>

						<p> I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)"> Galicia</a>, and I have had the pleasure to live in other beautiful places such as British Columbia, New York, and Cambridge. I enjoy all things outdoors, and I care deeply about social justice.
						<p> FAQ about my name: my first name is Ant√≥n, and I have two last names, Baleato and Lizancos, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs#Galician_names"> as is traditional in the Iberian peninsula and much of the world</a>. Baleato comes from my father, and Lizancos from my mother. You will find that in my articles I use both, but please feel free to refer to me just by one (typically Anton Baleato).  </p>
