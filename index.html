							<h2> Research</h2>
						</header>
						<p> I am interested in a wide range of topics in theoretical and data-driven cosmology, with a particular focus on how the phenomenon of gravitational lensing can be used to test the cosmological model and fundamental Physics.

                        <p>Along with my collaborators, I am actively exploring ways to remove the <a href="https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/research/cosmic-microwave-background-and-the-early-universe/CMB-lensing"> effect of gravitational lensing</a> due to the large-scale distribution of matter from the observed B-mode polarization of the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">cosmic microwave background (CMB)</a>. This is a crucial step in the search for the very weak primordial B-mode signal that is thought to have been produced by gravitational waves generated during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)"> cosmic inflation </a>, a tiny fraction of a second after the beginning of time.

                        <p> In parallel to this, we are developing analytic methods to model biases to CMB lensing (and to its cross-correlation with tracers of the matter distribution, such as galaxies) associated with the emission of clusters and galaxies. These probes allow for precise constraints on the mass of the neutrinos, dark energy and dark matter, so it is increasingly important to understand the systematic effects involved.</p>
							<p> Though I am a theorist, I like to work at the interface with data, and I am lucky to do this as member of the analysis working group of the <a href="https://simonsobservatory.org/">Simons Observatory (SO)</a>. Recently, I also became a member of the <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)</a>. In tandem, these two experiments promise to provide deep insights into the workings of our Universe; in particular, I am hoping to contribute to some exciting measurements of the cross-correlation between the galaxy locations determined by DESI and the matter distribution as inferred from CMB lensing.</p>

						<p> I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)"> Galicia</a>, and I have had the pleasure to live in other beautiful places such as British Columbia, New York, and Cambridge. I enjoy all things outdoors, and I care deeply about social justice.
						<p> FAQ about my name: my first name is Ant√≥n, and I have two last names, Baleato and Lizancos, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs#Galician_names"> as is traditional in the Iberian peninsula and much of the world</a>. Baleato comes from my father, and Lizancos from my mother. You will find that in my articles I use both, but please feel free to refer to me just by one (typically Anton Baleato).  </p>
