         The <a href="gamma_sign.gif">sign of gamma</a> identifies regions where variance cancellation can (in theory) lead to improved S/N. We can also visualize <a href="gamma.gif">gamma itself</a>. The ideal <a href="FracChangeInStoN.gif">gain in S/N</a> might often not be all that desirable in practice if the bias from signal suppression is large compared to the statistical uncertainty after cleaning (this can be assessed from the <a href="bias_over_noise_uncorrected.gif">ratio of bias to noise after cleaning</a>). We can mitigate this bias by, for example, restoring the signal based on measurements of the g-I correlation but only to the point where the mean-squared-error (MSE) is minimized. The fractional gain in S/N at the MSE optimum is shown <a href="FracChangeInStoN_jointpatches_fsky0.03_ell100.gif">here</a> for the case where cleaning and signal-correction are both performed on the same patch (fsky=0.03, l=100). Prospects are significantly improved when the g-I spectrum can be measured on a larger patch: for example, <a href="FracChangeInStoN_jointpatches_fsky0.03_ell100.gif">here</a> is the gain in S/N when the patch where g-I is measured has fsky=0.8 and the cleaning patch still has fsky=0.03 (still for l=100).
